## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the "Dogs vs Cats" dataset, downloaded from Kaggle. It consists of thousands of images of cats and dogs for training and testing the CNN model.

## Training and Evaluation
The model is trained using the training dataset and evaluated using the validation dataset. The loss function used is binary cross-entropy, and the optimizer used is Adam. The model is trained for multiple epochs, and both training and validation accuracies are monitored.

After training, the model's performance is evaluated on the validation dataset using accuracy as the metric. Additionally, the training and validation loss and accuracy curves are plotted to visualize the model's performance over epochs.

## Results
The trained CNN model achieves a validation accuracy of approximately 87.82% after 5 epochs of training. The model demonstrates the ability to accurately classify images of cats and dogs with high accuracy.
